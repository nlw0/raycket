# raycket
A basic ray-tracer made with Racket

This was at first just a port from my previous Clojure ray-tracer, [jayray](https://github.com/nlw0/jayray), and making the code even more horrible! Hopefuly I have learned something in the process and can make it better in the future.

Expected output:
